In this project, I have made use of Stateless and Stateful Widgets. Basically, the Stateless widget calls the ColorChangeApp, which is a Stateful widget, and within this widget contains a Stack widget that allows us to see the gif background(Container widget) as well as the Animated Container(under Center widget) that responds to the change of state provided by the input of Floating Action Button.       
<br><br>
The role of the said Button is to change the color of the Animated Container randomly when clicked.  
<br><br>
The Animated Container animates this random color change and is part of Animation in User Interface of the Documentation.    
<br><br>
Most of the added widgets are based on Flutter Documentation and some are researched by yours truly. And in this project, I found researching and reading the most useful in building the mobile app. Though it is hard since the parent-child relationship is deep in this project, I learned a lot in terms of User Interface and the skeleton of the program. Hope you enjoy it!!!
